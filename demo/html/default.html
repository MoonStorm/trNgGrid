                                Simply because everything else you're gonna find out there is either:
                            </p>
                            <lu>
                                <li>breaking the separation of concerns, forcing you to initialize it inside a controller, and not inside the view.</li>
                                <li>is using DIVs instead of the elements meant to display tabular data, hence performing poorly and also turning the rendered markup into spaghetti.</li>
                                <li>is over-engineered without giving you anything extra in return, making it just difficult to maintain.</li>
                            </lu>
                        </div>

                                <li>is built with simplicity in mind.</li>
                                <li>is using plain tables, allowing the browsers to optimize the rendering for performance.</li>
                                <li>allows you to fully describe it in a view, without messing up your controllers.</li>
                                <li>is fully customizable via two-way data bound attributes and templates.</li>
                                <li>is easy to maintain, as its code was written under the type safe TypeScript. The repository also has the pure JS implementation, so no need to worry if you don't want to learn a new technology (even though I strongly recommend this one).</li>
