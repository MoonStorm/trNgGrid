trNgGrid can be used for simple to mildly complex scenarios where you quickly need a data grid with a decent amount of features, which is easy to learn and to hook up with your data models thanks to its powerful data binding properties. All the configuration parameters can be set directly inside the view, hence you won't muddy your Angular scopes or controllers.

For more complex scenarios and more fine tuned control, I recommend trying out [Smart Table](http://lorenzofox3.github.io/smart-table-website/) or forking trNgGrid and tweaking it to suit your needs.

#### [Documentation and demo site](http://moonstorm.github.io/trNgGrid/release)

#### Installation
- `npm install tr-ng-grid --save` or
- `bower install tr-ng-grid --save` or
- download the grid from the master branch, which contains the latest release. The files you're interested in are `trNgGrid.min.css` and `trNgGrid.min.js`. 

Make sure you first include Angular and a Boostrap theme of your choice. 
Themes can be found on the Bootswatch website. 
Of course you can craft your own, as the grid layout is quite easy to style.

#### Legend
- Release: master, gh-pages/release
- Experimental: beta, gh-pages/beta
